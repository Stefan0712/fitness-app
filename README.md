# Fitness App (Work in Progress and open to name suggestions)  

Welcome to the **Fitness App**! 🚀  
This is a **React-based web application** designed to help users manage their fitness goals, track workouts, and monitor progress—all in one place. The app is currently a **work in progress**, but the goal is to create a simple, effective, and **free-to-use** alternative to the complicated and expensive fitness apps on the market.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This app is designed to:  
- Showcase my **web development skills** in React and Redux.  
- Provide a **personal fitness tracking tool** for myself and anyone else who wants to use it.  
- Serve as a **free, open-source** alternative to paid fitness apps.
